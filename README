Kaggle Titanic Competition

This is my effort at solving the Kaggle Titanic competition. I am using 
multiple Classifier Models, optimized with GridSearchCV, and then using
voting between their outputs to generate the answer.

NOTE:
The use of a Makefile was to generate each grid search independently, only
needing to regenerate them if the (engineered) dataset changes, or if the
parameters are tuned for that model. However, I have just been using a more
powerful computer to run the model, and did not finish the seperation. So,
the makefile is not very useful.

TODO:
* try one-hot encoding embarkment
* seperate GridSearch and voting to allow tuning of voting algorithm without
  running GridSearch
